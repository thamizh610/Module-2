# Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

## 🎯 Aim:

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

## 🧠 Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.


## 🧪 Program:
```
a=int(input())
for i in range(a):
    
    for j in range(a-i-1):
        print(end=" ")
    for m in range(i+1):          
             ncr=1
             if(i>0):
                ncr=1
                for k in range(1,m+1):
                     c=(i-k+1)/k
                     ncr=ncr*c
             print(int(ncr), end=" ")
    print("")
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the python program was executed successfully.
